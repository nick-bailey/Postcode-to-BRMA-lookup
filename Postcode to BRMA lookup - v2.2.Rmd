# Constructing a postcode to BRMA lookup file - v2.2 [January 2025]

This Rmd creates a lookup file linking unit postcodes to Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA) boundaries for the whole UK. BRMAs are the spatial areas used for the administration of Housing Benefit or Local Housing Allowance in GB. There are 200 BRMAs in total.

Final lookup ('pcode_brma_lookup.csv') has the following fields: 

* country: 1-character (E - England; N - Northern Ireland; S - Scotland; W - Wales)
* PCD: 7-character postcodes (may have one space or none)
* PCD2: 8-character postcodes (may have one space or two)
* PCDS: 7- or 8-character postcodes (always has one space)
* brma: the reference number, taken from the BRMA boundary files. NB 
* brma_name: the name for the BRMA.

### v2 UPDATE (MAY 2024)
Now using the postcode centroid file current for March 2024 (previously April 2023). Also added Northern Ireland. 

### v2.1 UPDATE (OCTOBER 2024)
An issue was highlighted regarding licence terms for Northern Ireland postcodes. While postcodes for Britain are published under Open Government Licence, those for Northern Ireland are not (https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/geography/central-postcode-directory). This is an extremely unhelpful situation which must impede the efforts of researchers who would like to cover the whole of the UK in their work. We have adopted a workaround solution to avoid infringement on copyright. The result is less efficient but it should work. We are very grateful to Owen Boswarva (https://www.owenboswarva.com/) for identifying this issue. He bears no responsibility for the solution adopted. 

### v2.2 UPDATE (JANUARY 2025)
Error in Scottish BRMA boundary dataset identified - West Dunbartonshire was missing.

### Scotland
Previously using the open dataset from Boswarva (2017). With v2.2, switched to using a download from Scottish Government (https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ecf60902-9e71-41bc-b822-6a1f37934dc1), also under Open Government Licence.

### Wales

Dataset released by Rent Officers Wales (part of the Housing Division of the Welsh Government) on 23 September 2014.

```{r brma wales}

# imports as BNG
sf_brma_wales <- st_read(here("data-input", "brma_wales", "wales_brma.shp"))

```

### NI
NI works from a manually created lookup, not from a boundary file, using a list of postcode 'outcodes' which constitute each BRMA. ('Outcodes' are the portion of the postcode before the space, also known as postcode districts.) These taken from NIHE webpages (May 2024): https://www.nihe.gov.uk/housing-help/local-housing-allowance/current-lha-rent-levels

## Pcode in BRMAs
Make the lookup between postcodes and BRMAs, then add variables for each and reduce to those necessary for the lookup file. NB that, when using bounary files, there are many postcode centroids which fall outside any BRMA - almost entirely coastal. Seem to be using different definitions of the coast. For speed, do most pcodes using sf_intersects(), then identify the unmatched postcodes, and use sf_nearest() for remainder (much slower). This process is why it was necessary to split the postcode centroid file by country first. 

### England

### NI
For NI, we use a different approach to avoid using NI postcodes as they are not available under OGL. Instead, we generate a list of every possible postcode in NI and associate each with a BRMA using the outcodes-BRMA list taken from the NIHE website. The incode section comprises: one digit (0-9) and two letters, taken from a list of 20 (i.e. not using [CIKMOV]). That gives 4000 permutations for each outcode, or 320,000 in total. Note that this includes a very large number of cases which are not in fact real postcodes (more than 80%). This makes any linkage much less efficient but it should still work. 


```{r pcode brma ni}

### CODE REMOVED TO AVOID USING NI POSTCODES
# # take full pcodes from sf and merge brma based on outcode
# df_pcode_brma_ni <- as.data.frame(sf_pcode_ni) %>%

#   filter(!is.na(PCD)) %>% 
#   mutate(PCD_out = word(PCDS, 1, sep = " ")) %>% 
#   left_join(df_brma_ni, by = 'PCD_out') %>% 
#   select(-PCD_out) %>% 
#   mutate(country = "N")

# table(df_pcode_brma_ni$brma)


### NEW CODE 
# generate every possible incode permutation for each outcode and make all possible NI postcodes
# add BRMA information
df_pcode_brma_ni <- data.frame(expand.grid(PCD_out = df_brma_ni$PCD_out,

# Postcode-to-BRMA-lookup
Rmd to produce lookup up, linking unit postcodes in the UK to Broad Rental Market Areas (BRMAs). BRMAs are spatial units used for the administration of housing allowances for households in rented accommodation. Data available from Urban Big Data Centre: https://data.ubdc.ac.uk/datasets?q=%22postcode+to+Broad+Rental+Market+Area%22

Postcodes in Northern Ireland are not available as open data. The lookup adopts a somewhat ugly workaround by creating every possible postcode in the form "BTxx xxx" and associating it with the relevant BRMA. The great majority of 'postcodes' listed for Northern Ireland do not therefore exist in practice (c. 80%). Nevertheless, the lookup should still function, albeit less efficiently. This is another price to be paid for the lack of open data.
